            <h3>Research Trainee at UNESCO-RCB</h3>
            <p>
                Currently immersed in structural biology as a Research Trainee at UNESCO-RCB, Faridabad, under the guidance of Prof. Dr. Deepak T. Nair.
                My primary focus is understanding the mysteries of the clamp loader complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the cutting-edge Cryo-EM technique, with a touch of finesse from the CryoSPARC software.

            <h3>MSc Dissertation - "Cloning, purification, and reconstitution of the multi-subunit clamp loader"</h3>
            <p>
                Recently completed a captivating dissertation project under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Deepak T. Nair.
                Successfully cloned genes, danced through chromatography techniques for purification, and orchestrated the reunion of subunits into a formidable protein complex.
                Let's not forget the captivating negative stain electron microscopy for that structural flair!
