        <!--🔬 **Research Enthusiast at UNESCO-RCB, Faridabad 🌐**

Hey there! I am currently immersed in structural biology as a Research Trainee at UNESCO-RCB, Faridabad, under the guidance of the brilliant Prof. Dr. Deepak T. Nair. My primary focus is understanding the mysteries of the clamp loader complex from Mycobacterium tuberculosis using the cutting-edge Cryo-EM technique, with a touch of finesse from the CryoSPARC software.

🎓 **MSc Alchemist (Sep '22 - Aug '23) 🧪**

I recently wrapped up a captivating dissertation project, also under the mentorship of Prof. Dr. Deepak T. Nair. Titled "Cloning, purification, and reconstitution of the multi-subunit clamp loader," this year-long journey involved wielding molecular magic—I successfully cloned genes, danced through chromatography techniques for purification, and orchestrated the reunion of subunits into a formidable protein complex. Let's not forget the captivating negative stain electron microscopy for that structural flair!

🔍 **Summer Internship Adventurer (May '18 - July '18) 🌞**

During a short but impactful summer stint at Kalyani University, West Bengal, under the keen eye of Dr. Arunima Biswas, I dived into the world of elevated phosphodiesterase expression and its dance with cAMP levels in breast cancer stem cells. Mastering Western blotting, cell culture, and cytotoxicity assays, I uncovered the secrets of cellular communications.

🌿 **Field Explorer Extraordinaire (Sep '18 - Oct '18) 🌏**

Venturing into the wilds of Sagar Island, West Bengal, I participated in a biodiversity expedition organised by the Zoology Dept. Our mission: unravel the secrets of Sagar Island's diverse ecosystem. Armed with identification skills and geotagging prowess, we left no leaf unturned.

📝 **Scientific Wordsmith (2019) 📚**

In my undergraduate days at Ramakrishna Mission Vidyamandira, West Bengal, I delved into the intricacies of Alzheimer's disease aetiology. The culmination? A compelling review paper under the guidance of Dr. Anirban Sengupta.

Welcome to my virtual corner! Join me on this journey of scientific exploration and discovery. 🚀✨
